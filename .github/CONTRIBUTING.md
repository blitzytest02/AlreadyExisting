## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to the Node.js Tutorial project:

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the tutorial application, please help us by reporting them. To report a bug:

1. **Check existing issues** - Search through existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** - Create a new issue using our bug report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`)
3. **Provide detailed information** - Include:
   - Node.js version (we recommend v22.16.0 LTS)
   - Express.js version (should be 5.1.0)
   - Operating system and version
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Any error messages or logs

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements to the tutorial application. To suggest an enhancement:

1. **Check existing feature requests** - Review existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the feature request template** - Create a new issue using our feature request template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`)
3. **Describe your suggestion** - Include:
   - Clear description of the proposed feature
   - Educational value for Node.js learners
   - Implementation considerations
   - Any relevant examples or references

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the primary method for code contributions. We encourage you to contribute code that:
- Improves the educational value of the tutorial
- Fixes bugs or security issues
- Enhances code quality and readability
- Adds useful comments and documentation

## Getting Started

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up your local development environment:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js v22.16.0 LTS** - This tutorial uses the latest Long Term Support version with codename 'Jod'
- **npm** - Comes bundled with Node.js (version 11.4.1 or later)
- **Git** - For version control

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork the repository on GitHub**
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page

2. **Clone the forked repository to your local machine**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nodejs-tutorial.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies using npm**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This reads the `package.json` file and installs Express.js 5.1.0 and other dependencies.

5. **Create a local environment file from the example**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This uses `nodemon` as configured in `nodemon.json` for automatic server restarts during development.

### Verify Your Setup

After starting the development server, verify everything is working:

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/hello`
2. You should see "Hello world" response
3. Check the console for any error messages

## Pull Request Process

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure you follow these guidelines:

### Pre-submission Checklist

1. **Clean up dependencies**
   - Ensure that any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build

2. **Update documentation**
   - Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
   - Include new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters

3. **Version management**
   - Increase the version numbers in any examples and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent

4. **Testing requirements**
   - Ensure your code passes all tests by running:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```
   - Tests are executed using the configuration defined in `jest.config.js`

5. **Code quality standards**
   - Ensure your code adheres to the linting rules defined in `.eslintrc.js`
   - Follow formatting rules specified in `.prettierrc`
   - Run the following commands to check your code:
     ```bash
     npm run lint
     npm run format
     ```

### Submission Process

1. **Create your pull request**
   - Use the pull request template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Reference any related issues using keywords like "Fixes #123"

2. **CI Pipeline validation**
   - The CI pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` must pass
   - This includes automated testing, linting, and security checks

3. **Code review process**
   - A code owner from `.github/CODEOWNERS` will review your pull request
   - Address any feedback or requested changes
   - Ensure all conversations are resolved before merge

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the purpose of your changes:
- `feature/add-error-handling`
- `fix/security-vulnerability`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `test/improve-coverage`

## Coding Standards

This project follows strict coding standards to ensure code quality, maintainability, and educational value:

### Code Style

- **JavaScript Standard**: We use ES2022+ features supported by Node.js v22
- **Async/Await**: Prefer modern async/await syntax over callbacks
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Comments**: Include meaningful comments that explain the "why" behind complex logic

### Framework Guidelines

- **Express.js 5.1.0**: Leverage the latest features including automatic promise rejection handling
- **Middleware**: Use Express middleware patterns for request processing
- **Route Organization**: Keep routes simple and focused for educational clarity
- **Security**: Follow security best practices using Helmet.js and input validation

### Performance Considerations

- **Response Time**: Maintain response times under 100ms for the `/hello` endpoint
- **Memory Usage**: Keep memory footprint below 50MB during operation
- **Startup Time**: Ensure server startup completes within 5 seconds

### Educational Value

Remember that this is a tutorial project designed to teach Node.js concepts:
- **Clarity over Complexity**: Choose clear, readable code over complex optimizations
- **Documentation**: Include extensive comments explaining Node.js concepts
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate production-ready patterns while maintaining simplicity

## Testing Guidelines

All contributions must include appropriate testing:

### Test Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules
- **Integration Tests**: Test the `/hello` endpoint using Supertest
- **Coverage**: Maintain at least 90% code coverage
- **Performance**: Ensure tests complete within 30 seconds

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch
```

## Security Guidelines

Security is important even in tutorial applications:

### Security Practices

- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, even for simple endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and run `npm audit` regularly
- **Headers**: Use Helmet.js for security headers
- **Logging**: Log security events appropriately

### Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. Email the maintainers directly with details
3. Allow time for the vulnerability to be addressed before public disclosure
