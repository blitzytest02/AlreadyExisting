## About This Project

This Node.js tutorial application serves as an educational resource for developers learning Node.js and Express.js fundamentals. The application demonstrates modern web server capabilities through a simple HTTP endpoint implementation, featuring a single `/hello` endpoint that returns a "Hello world" response to HTTP clients.

### Project Scope and Educational Goals

The tutorial addresses the need for practical, hands-on learning materials in the Node.js ecosystem. Many developers require simple, working examples to understand the basics of server-side JavaScript development, HTTP request handling, and modern web application architecture.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Modern Node.js development practices using Node.js v22.16.01 with long-term support
- Express.js 5.1.0 framework implementation and middleware patterns
- HTTP server fundamentals and RESTful endpoint creation
- Best practices for project structure and dependency management
- Foundation for scalable web application development

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Node.js v22.16.0 LTS (Active LTS with codename 'Jod')
- **Framework**: Express.js 5.1.0 (latest stable release)
- **Package Manager**: npm 11.4.1
- **Language**: JavaScript ES2022+ with modern syntax support

### Key Framework Features
- **Enhanced Promise Support**: Express 5.1.0 includes automatic forwarding of rejected promises to error-handling middleware
- **Security Improvements**: Updated to path-to-regexp@8.x for ReDoS attack mitigation
- **Modern Compatibility**: Requires Node.js 18 or higher, fully compatible with v22 LTS

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
The application employs a **Single-Threaded Event-Driven Architecture** pattern, leveraging Node.js's event loop design for efficient HTTP request processing. The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation between the HTTP transport layer, application framework layer, and business logic layer.

**Architectural Principles:**
- Event-driven processing with non-blocking I/O operations
- Modular design with separation of concerns
- Stateless operation for educational clarity
- Scalable patterns suitable for production extension

### Core Components
- **HTTP Server**: Handles network connections and request/response processing
- **Express Application**: Manages routing, middleware, and application lifecycle
- **Route Handler**: Implements business logic for the `/hello` endpoint
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and secure error responses

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Targets
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for all requests
- **Server Startup**: < 5 seconds application initialization
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB during normal operation
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for local development

### Monitoring and Health Checks
The application includes basic monitoring capabilities:
- Process uptime tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Response time measurement
- Error rate tracking
- Basic health check endpoint

## Security Implementation

### Security Measures
While designed for educational use, the application implements fundamental security practices:
- **HTTP Security Headers**: Basic security hardening using industry standards
- **Input Validation**: Method and path validation to prevent basic attacks
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses that prevent information disclosure
- **Dependency Security**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Secure Coding**: Follows OWASP guidelines and Node.js security best practices

### Security Evolution Path
The application provides a foundation for implementing production-grade security including HTTPS, authentication, authorization, and data protection as requirements evolve.
