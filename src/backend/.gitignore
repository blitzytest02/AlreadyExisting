# Dependency directories
# Ignores the directory containing all Node.js project dependencies installed by npm.
# This is a standard practice to avoid committing a large number of files that can be restored with `npm install`.
node_modules/

# Environment variables
# Ignores the environment variables file, which typically contains sensitive information like API keys,
# database credentials, and other secrets. This prevents accidental exposure of credentials in the repository.
.env

# Test coverage reports
# Ignores the directory generated by testing frameworks like Jest, which contains code coverage reports.
# These reports are artifacts generated during development and testing and should not be versioned.
coverage/

# Build output directory
# Ignores the output directory for compiled or transpiled code, if a build step is introduced.
# This keeps build artifacts out of the source repository.
build/

# Log files
# Ignores all files with a `.log` extension. Log files are generated during runtime and can contain
# sensitive or environment-specific information, and they are not part of the source code.
*.log

# Development tool configurations
# Ignores the nodemon configuration file, which is specific to the local development environment
# for auto-restarting the server.
nodemon.json
