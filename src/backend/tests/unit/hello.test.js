/**
 * Hello Endpoint Unit Test Suite
 * 
 * This test suite validates the functionality of the `/hello` endpoint using Jest
 * testing framework and Supertest library for HTTP assertions. The tests ensure
 * that the endpoint responds correctly according to the technical specifications
 * and requirements defined in TC-003 and TC-004.
 * 
 * Test Architecture:
 * - Jest provides the testing framework with describe/it structure
 * - Supertest creates HTTP requests without starting a live server
 * - Express app instance is tested directly through Supertest integration
 * - Tests verify both successful responses and error conditions
 * 
 * Requirements Coverage:
 * - TC-003: API Endpoint Test - Validates /hello endpoint functionality
 * - TC-004: Response Content Test - Verifies correct response content
 * - Unit Testing Strategy: Implements Jest and Supertest as specified
 * 
 * Technical Specifications Implementation:
 * - Express.js 5.1.0 application testing with enhanced promise support
 * - HTTP status code validation for successful and error responses
 * - Response content validation for exact text matching
 * - Non-blocking test execution with async/await patterns

     * Successful Response Test Case
     * 
     * Tests that a GET request to the `/hello` endpoint returns the expected
     * "Hello world" response with an HTTP 200 status code. This test validates
     * the core functionality of the hello endpoint as specified in F-002-RQ-002.
     * 
     * Test Scenario:
     * 1. Send HTTP GET request to /hello endpoint
     * 2. Verify response status code is 200 (OK)
     * 3. Verify response body contains exact text "Hello world"
     * 4. Ensure response is generated within performance targets
     * 
     * Requirements Validation:
     * - F-002-RQ-001: Route handler responds to /hello path
     * - F-002-RQ-002: Returns exact "Hello world" text content
     * - F-002-RQ-003: Supports GET HTTP method
     * - F-004-RQ-003: Delivers content in response body
     * 
     * Testing Implementation:
     * - Uses Supertest's request() function with Express app instance
     * - Performs HTTP GET request without starting live server
     * - Validates status code using .expect(200) assertion
     * - Validates response content using .expect('Hello world') assertion
     * 
     * Performance Validation:
     * - Response time should be < 100ms as per F-002 performance criteria
     * - Memory usage should remain minimal during request processing
     * - No resource leaks or hanging connections

     * This test ensures the application correctly handles requests to routes
     * that don't exist in the routing configuration.

     * 4. Validate that error doesn't crash the application

     * Error Handling Validation:
     * - Express.js default 404 handling for unmatched routes
     * - Application remains stable after error responses
     * - Error responses don't expose sensitive implementation details
     * - Proper HTTP status code semantics for client applications
     * 
     * Security Considerations:
     * - Error responses don't reveal internal application structure
     * - No stack traces or debugging information exposed to clients
     * - Generic error messages prevent information disclosure attacks
     * - Application continues normal operation after error responses
     * 
     * Testing Implementation:
     * - Uses descriptive non-existent route path for clear test intent
     * - Validates only status code as error message format may vary
     * - Ensures error handling middleware functions correctly
     * - Verifies Express.js default error handling behavior
