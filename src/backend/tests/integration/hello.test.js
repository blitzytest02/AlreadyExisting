    /**
     * Server Startup Hook - beforeAll
     * 
     * Starts the HTTP server on an ephemeral port before running any tests in this suite.
     * This ensures the application is ready to accept requests and provides a clean
     * testing environment isolated from other test suites or development servers.
     * 
     * Ephemeral Port Strategy:
     * - Port 0 instructs the operating system to assign a random available port
     * - Prevents port conflicts in CI/CD environments and parallel test execution
     * - Ensures test isolation and independence from external services
     * - Allows multiple test suites to run simultaneously without interference
     * 
     * Server Initialization Process:
     * 1. HTTP server instance listens on OS-assigned ephemeral port
     * 2. Express application becomes available for handling HTTP requests
     * 3. All middleware and routing configurations are active and ready
     * 4. Test execution can proceed with confidence in server availability
     * 
     * Asynchronous Testing Pattern:
     * - Uses Jest's done callback pattern for handling asynchronous operations
     * - Server.listen() callback signals completion of server startup process
     * - done() invocation informs Jest that async setup is complete
     * - Prevents test execution until server is fully operational
     * 
     * Error Handling:
     * - Server startup failures will cause test suite to fail immediately
     * - Clear error reporting for debugging server configuration issues
     * - Proper cleanup even in case of startup failures
     * - Integration with Jest's error handling and reporting mechanisms
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * - Startup time typically under 1 second for simple Express applications
     * - Memory footprint minimal with basic middleware and single endpoint
     * - CPU usage negligible during idle server state
     * - Network resource allocation through ephemeral port assignment
     * 
     * CI/CD Compatibility:
     * - No hardcoded port dependencies preventing deployment conflicts
     * - Automatic port detection suitable for containerized test environments
     * - Parallel test execution support through isolated port allocation
     * - Cloud CI/CD platform compatibility with dynamic port assignment
     * 
     * @param {Function} done - Jest callback function to signal completion of async setup

    /**
     * Server Shutdown Hook - afterAll
     * 
     * Stops the HTTP server after all tests in this suite have finished executing.
     * This ensures proper resource cleanup and allows the test process to exit
     * cleanly without hanging connections or resource leaks.
     * 
     * Cleanup Operations:
     * - Closes all active HTTP connections and prevents new connections
     * - Releases the network port allocated during server startup
     * - Deallocates server-related memory and system resources
     * - Ensures clean test environment reset for subsequent test suites
     * 
     * Resource Management:
     * - Prevents memory leaks from persistent server instances
     * - Releases network ports for reuse by other processes
     * - Cleans up event listeners and timers associated with server
     * - Ensures proper garbage collection of server-related objects
     * 
     * Test Process Lifecycle:
     * - Allows Jest test runner to exit cleanly after test completion
     * - Prevents hanging Node.js processes in CI/CD environments
     * - Ensures proper test isolation between different test suite executions
     * - Maintains clean state for subsequent test runs
     * 
     * Error Handling:
     * - Server.close() callback provides error handling for shutdown failures
     * - Proper error reporting if server cannot be gracefully shut down
     * - Timeout handling for servers that don't respond to close requests
     * - Integration with Jest's cleanup and error reporting mechanisms
     * 
     * Performance Impact:
     * - Minimal shutdown time for simple Express applications (< 100ms)
     * - No blocking operations during graceful shutdown process
     * - Efficient resource deallocation without memory fragmentation
     * - Clean process termination enabling fast test suite completion
     * 
     * Production Testing Patterns:
     * - Demonstrates proper server lifecycle management for production deployments
     * - Shows graceful shutdown patterns for container orchestration
     * - Provides foundation for health check and readiness probe implementations
     * - Establishes patterns for zero-downtime deployment scenarios

     * - Route handler execution and response generation
     * - HTTP status code and header generation
     * - Response content delivery and format validation

     * - Provides comprehensive assertion methods for response validation
     * - Handles async request processing with Promise-based patterns
     * - Integrates seamlessly with Jest's async testing capabilities
     * 
     * Request Processing Flow Validation:
     * 1. HTTP GET request sent to /hello endpoint
     * 2. Express application receives and parses request
     * 3. Request logging middleware captures request details
     * 4. Main router performs path matching for /hello
     * 5. Hello router delegates to appropriate route handler
     * 6. Route handler generates "Hello world" response
     * 7. Response sent back through middleware stack to client
     * 8. Test assertions validate complete response

     * - F-002-RQ-002: Tests exact "Hello world" text requirement
     * - F-004-RQ-003: Validates response body content delivery
     * 
     * Performance Validation:
     * - Response time should be under 100ms (F-002 performance criteria)
     * - Memory usage should remain minimal during request processing
     * - No resource leaks or connection handling issues
     * - Efficient request throughput with minimal latency

     * This test ensures the application gracefully handles invalid requests

     * - Error Response Management: Validates structured error processing
     * - HTTP Protocol Compliance: Ensures proper status code usage
     * - Client Error Handling: Provides appropriate feedback for invalid requests
     * 
     * Security Considerations:
     * - No sensitive information disclosure in error responses
     * - Generic error messages prevent information leakage
     * - No stack traces or internal details exposed to clients
     * - Consistent error response format across all 404 scenarios
     * 
     * Error Response Format:
     * - HTTP 404 Not Found status code
     * - Appropriate error headers set by Express
     * - Generic error message without implementation details
     * - Consistent format matching application error handling patterns
     * 
     * Testing Strategy:
     * - Uses a clearly non-existent route path for testing
     * - Validates only the essential error response characteristics
     * - Avoids testing implementation-specific error details
     * - Focuses on client-facing behavior rather than internal mechanisms
     * 
     * Performance Considerations:
     * - 404 responses should be generated quickly (< 50ms)
     * - No unnecessary processing for obviously invalid routes
     * - Efficient route matching failure detection
     * - Minimal resource consumption for error responses
     * 
     * Integration with Express Error Handling:
     * - Tests the complete Express error handling pipeline
     * - Validates error middleware execution for unmatched routes

     * 3. Concurrent Request Testing:
     *    - Send multiple simultaneous requests to validate thread safety
     *    - Test server stability under concurrent load

     * 4. Edge Case Testing:
     *    - Test requests with very long URLs or unusual characters
     *    - Validate handling of malformed HTTP requests
