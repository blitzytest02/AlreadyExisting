// Express.js v5.1.0 - Latest stable release with enhanced promise support and automatic error handling
const express = require('express');

/**
 * Express Router Instance for Hello Endpoint
 * 
 * Creates a new Express Router instance specifically for handling the /hello endpoint.
 * This router will be mounted in the main application router to handle requests
 * to the /hello path as specified in F-002-RQ-001.
 * 
 * Express 5.1.0 features utilized:
 * - Enhanced promise support with automatic rejection handling
 * - Updated path-to-regexp@8.x for improved security (ReDoS mitigation)
 * - Improved middleware error handling capabilities
 */

/**
 * GET /hello Endpoint Handler
 * 
 * Handles HTTP GET requests to the root path of this router (which corresponds
 * to /hello when mounted in the main application). This endpoint implements
 * the core business logic for the hello world demonstration.
 * 
 * Requirements Implementation:
 * - F-002-RQ-001: Defines the route handler for the /hello path
 * - F-002-RQ-002: Returns the exact text "Hello world"
 * - F-002-RQ-003: Supports only the GET HTTP method
 * - F-004-RQ-003: Sends the "Hello world" text in the response body
 * 
 * Technical Specifications:
 * - Response Time Target: < 100ms (F-002 performance criteria)
 * - HTTP Status: 200 (implicit success status)
 * - Content-Type: text/plain (automatically set by Express res.send())
 * - Response Body: "Hello world" (exact text as specified)
 * 
 * @route GET /
 * @param {express.Request} req - Express request object containing HTTP request data
 * @param {express.Response} res - Express response object for sending HTTP response
 * @returns {void} Terminates the request-response cycle by sending response to client
 */
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    /**
     * Response Generation Process:
     * 
     * 1. Express automatically sets the HTTP status to 200 for successful requests
     * 2. The res.send() method automatically sets the Content-Type header based on the data type
     * 3. For string data, Content-Type is set to 'text/html; charset=utf-8' by default
     * 4. The response body contains the exact "Hello world" text as required
     * 
     * Express 5.x Benefits:
     * - Automatic promise rejection handling (though not needed for this synchronous operation)
     * - Enhanced security through updated dependencies
     * - Improved error handling middleware integration
     */
    
    // Send the exact "Hello world" response as specified in F-002-RQ-002
    // This fulfills F-004-RQ-003 by delivering the content in the response body
    res.send('Hello world');
    
    /**
     * Response Lifecycle:
     * 
     * 1. Request received and parsed by Express middleware stack
     * 2. Route matching performed using path-to-regexp@8.x (enhanced security)
     * 3. Handler function executed with req/res objects
     * 4. res.send() called with "Hello world" string
     * 5. Express sets appropriate headers and status code
     * 6. Response sent to client, completing the request-response cycle
     * 
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Processing time: < 25ms (handler execution target)
     * - Memory usage: Minimal (static string response)
     * - CPU usage: Negligible (no complex processing)

/**
 * Router Export
 * 
 * Exports the configured Express router as the default export so it can be
 * imported and mounted by the main application router in src/backend/routes/index.js.
 * 
 * Export Type: Default export (CommonJS module.exports)
 * Usage: This router will be mounted at the /hello path in the main application
 * 
 * Integration Pattern:
 * - Main app imports this router: const helloRouter = require('./routes/hello')
 * - Main app mounts router: app.use('/hello', helloRouter)
 * - Final endpoint accessible at: GET /hello
 * 
 * Architecture Benefits:
 * - Modular route organization following Express.js best practices
 * - Separation of concerns between different API endpoints
 * - Scalable structure for adding additional route handlers
 * - Clear traceability as specified in the implementation matrix
