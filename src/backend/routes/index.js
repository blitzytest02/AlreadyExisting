// Express.js v5.1.0 - Latest stable release with enhanced promise support and automatic error handling

// Internal route modules - Import individual route handlers for modular architecture
const helloRouter = require('./hello.js');

/**
 * Main Application Router
 * 
 * This file serves as the central routing hub for the Express application, implementing
 * a modular routing architecture that aggregates and mounts individual route modules
 * on their respective paths. This approach follows Express.js best practices for
 * scalable application design and clear separation of concerns.
 * 
 * Architectural Benefits:
 * - Modular Design: Each endpoint group has its own dedicated router module
 * - Scalability: Easy to add new route modules without modifying existing code
 * - Maintainability: Clear separation between routing configuration and business logic
 * - Testability: Individual route modules can be tested in isolation
 * 
 * Express 5.1.0 Features Utilized:
 * - Enhanced promise support with automatic rejection handling
 * - Updated path-to-regexp@8.x for improved security (ReDoS mitigation)
 * - Improved middleware error handling capabilities
 * - Automatic forwarding of rejected promises to error-handling middleware
 * 
 * Requirements Implementation:
 * - F-002: Hello Endpoint Implementation - Integrates hello endpoint router
 * - F-003-RQ-002: Route matching - Matches /hello path and delegates to specific router
 * - Modular Design: Implements separation between main router and endpoint routers
 * - Traceability Matrix: Core dependency of app.js providing application's routing tree

/**
 * Express Router Instance Creation
 * 
 * Creates a new Express Router instance that will serve as the main application
 * router. This router will be mounted in the main Express application (app.js)
 * and will handle all incoming requests by delegating them to appropriate
 * sub-routers based on path matching.
 * 
 * Express 5.x Router Features:
 * - Automatic promise rejection handling for middleware functions
 * - Enhanced error propagation through middleware stack
 * - Improved path-to-regexp integration for secure route matching
 * - Built-in support for async/await patterns in route handlers
 * 
 * Router Configuration:
 * - Case sensitive: false (default Express behavior)
 * - Merge params: false (default, parameters don't merge from parent to child)
 * - Strict routing: false (default, trailing slashes are ignored)
 */
const router = express.Router();

/**
 * Route Module Configuration and Mounting
 * 
 * This section configures and mounts individual route modules onto specific
 * base paths. Each mounted router handles all requests that match its base path
 * and delegates further routing decisions to the mounted router module.
 * 
 * Mounting Strategy:
 * - Base path mounting ensures clear URL namespace separation
 * - Sub-router independence allows for module-specific middleware
 * - Hierarchical routing structure supports complex application architectures
 * - Path prefix delegation enables clean URL design patterns
 */

/**
 * Hello Endpoint Router Mounting
 * 
 * Mounts the hello endpoint router on the '/hello' base path. This configuration
 * means that any HTTP request with a path starting with '/hello' will be
 * forwarded to and handled by the helloRouter module.
 * 
 * Route Delegation Process:
 * 1. Main router receives request with path starting with '/hello'
 * 2. Path matching occurs using Express's path-to-regexp@8.x engine
 * 3. Request is delegated to helloRouter with remaining path
 * 4. helloRouter processes the request using its internal route definitions
 * 5. Response is generated and sent back through the main router
 * 
 * URL Mapping Examples:
 * - GET /hello → Handled by helloRouter's '/' route
 * - GET /hello/ → Handled by helloRouter's '/' route (trailing slash ignored)
 * - GET /hello/test → Would be handled by helloRouter's '/test' route (if defined)
 * 
 * Requirements Fulfillment:
 * - F-002-RQ-001: Defines route handling for /hello path through router mounting
 * - F-003-RQ-002: Implements exact path matching for '/hello' requests
 * - Modular Architecture: Separates hello endpoint logic from main routing concerns
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Express 5.x automatically forwards promise rejections to error middleware
 * - Path matching failures result in 404 responses (handled by Express)
 * - Router-level errors are propagated to application error handlers
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - O(1) route lookup time due to path-to-regexp optimization
 * - Minimal memory overhead for route registration
 * - No additional middleware overhead during request processing
 * - Efficient delegation to specialized route handlers

router.use('/hello', helloRouter);

/**
 * Future Route Module Mounting Points
 * 
 * This section is reserved for mounting additional route modules as the
 * application grows. Following the same pattern as the hello router mounting,
 * new endpoints can be easily integrated without modifying existing code.
 * 
 * Example Future Mountings:
 * router.use('/api/users', userRouter);     // User management endpoints
 * router.use('/api/auth', authRouter);      // Authentication endpoints
 * router.use('/api/data', dataRouter);      // Data processing endpoints
 * router.use('/health', healthRouter);      // Health check endpoints
 * 
 * Scalability Benefits:
 * - Easy addition of new feature modules
 * - Clear namespace separation between functional areas
 * - Independent development and testing of route modules
 * - Supports microservice decomposition patterns

/**
 * Router Export Configuration
 * 
 * Exports the configured main router as the default export for consumption
 * by the core application file (app.js). This router contains all the
 * mounted sub-routers and serves as the complete routing tree for the application.
 * 
 * Integration Pattern:
 * - app.js imports this router: const routes = require('./routes')
 * - app.js mounts router: app.use('/', routes) or app.use('/api', routes)
 * - Complete routing hierarchy is established through this mounting
 * 
 * Export Type: Default CommonJS Export
 * - Compatible with both require() and import statements
 * - Follows Node.js module system conventions
 * - Enables tree-shaking in modern bundlers (if used)
 * 
 * Router Lifecycle:
 * 1. Router instance created and configured
 * 2. Sub-routers mounted on their respective paths
 * 3. Router exported for application consumption
 * 4. Application mounts router to complete routing setup
 * 5. Router handles incoming requests through delegation pattern
 * 
 * Dependencies and Integration:
 * - Depends on: Express.js 5.1.0 framework, individual route modules
 * - Consumed by: Main application file (app.js)
 * - Provides: Complete routing tree for HTTP request handling
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Route isolation prevents cross-contamination between modules
 * - Path-to-regexp@8.x provides ReDoS attack mitigation
 * - No authentication logic at router level (delegated to route handlers)
 * - Standard Express security practices applied throughout
